Title: Multiple Imputation of Single-Level and Multilevel Binary and Ordinal Variables that are Supposed to be MNAR
Version: 1.0
Author: Angelina Hammon
Maintainer: Angelina Hammon <angelina.hammon@gmx.de>
Description: Provides imputation methods and functions based on selection models for binary and ordinal-scaled MNAR data that can be used within the 'mice' package and its FCS algorithm. There are versions for single-level and multilevel data which both are based on bivariate selection models. The multilevel models are estimated using quadrature techniques. The model for binary variables is described in Hammon & Zinn (2020) and the method for ordinal variables can be found in Hammon (2022).
